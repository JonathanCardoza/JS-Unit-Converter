        The kelvin is the base unit of temperature in the International System of Units (SI), having the unit symbol K.
        It is named after the Belfast-born Glasgow University engineer and physicist William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin (1824–1907).
        The Kelvin scale fulfills Thomson's requirements as an absolute thermodynamic temperature scale.
        It uses absolute zero as its null point (i.e. low entropy). The relation between kelvin and Celsius scales is TK = t°C + 273.15.

        <h2 style="font-size:130%;">Background: Celsius</h2>
        The degree Celsius is a unit of temperature on the Celsius scale, a temperature scale originally known as the centigrade scale.
        the degree Celsius (symbol: °C) can refer to a specific temperature on the Celsius scale or a unit to indicate a difference or range between two temperatures. 
        It is named after the Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius (1701–1744), who developed a similar temperature scale.
        Before being renamed to honor Anders Celsius in 1948, the unit was called centigrade, from the Latin centum, which means 100, and gradus, which means steps.
        Since 1743 the Celsius scale has been based on 0 °C for the freezing point of water and 100 °C for the boiling point of water at 1 atm pressure. 
        Prior to 1743 the values were reversed (i.e. the boiling point was 0 degrees and the freezing point was 100 degrees). 
        The 1743 scale reversal was proposed by Jean-Pierre Christin.
