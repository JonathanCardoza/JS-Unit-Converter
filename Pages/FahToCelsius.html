       The Fahrenheit scale (/ˈfærənhaɪt/ or /ˈfɑːrənhaɪt/) is a temperature scale based on one proposed
       in 1724 by the physicist Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit (1686–1736).
       The Fahrenheit scale is now usually defined by two fixed points with a 180 °F separation:
       he temperature at which pure water freezes is defined as 32 °F and 
       the boiling point of water is defined to be 212 °F, both at sea level and under standard atmospheric pressure.

        <h2 style="font-size:130%;">Background: Celsius</h2>
        The degree Celsius is a unit of temperature on the Celsius scale, a temperature scale originally known as the centigrade scale.
        the degree Celsius (symbol: °C) can refer to a specific temperature  on the Celsius scale or a unit to indicate a difference or range between two temperatures. 
        It is named after the Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius (1701–1744), who developed a similar temperature scale.
        Before being renamed to honor Anders Celsius in 1948, the unit was called centigrade, from the Latin centum, which means 100, and gradus, which means steps.
        Since 1743 the Celsius scale has been based on 0 °C for the freezing point of water and 100 °C for the boiling point of water at 1 atm pressure. 
        Prior to 1743 the values were reversed (i.e. the boiling point was 0 degrees and the freezing point was 100 degrees). 
        The 1743 scale reversal was proposed by Jean-Pierre Christin.
