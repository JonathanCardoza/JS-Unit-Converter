        A foot(ft) is a unit of length in the British imperial and United States customary systems of measurement. 
        Historically the "foot" was a part of many local systems of units, including the Greek, Roman, Chinese, French, and English systems.
        It varied in length from country to country, from city to city, and sometimes from trade to trade. 
        Its length was usually between 250 mm and 335 mm and was generally, but not always, subdivided into 12 inches or 16 digits.
